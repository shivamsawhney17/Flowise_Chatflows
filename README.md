# Flowise_Chatflows
This repo contains the various chatflows which I have created using Flowise AI

Use the Setup folder to install Flowise onto your local machine. Use the "run_win.bat" file for Windows systems and the "run_lx_mac.shell" file for Linux and mac.

Each Chatflow folder has a PDF file which contains the SOP for running that particular chatflow.
